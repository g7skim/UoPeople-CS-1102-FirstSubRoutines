The program is a part of the ‘firstsubroutines’ class.ffffffff

The program prompt the user to enter a string. The program then test the string entered by the user to determine
whether it is a palindrome. 
A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards and forwards,
such as "radar", "racecar", and "able was I ere I saw elba". 
It is customary to ignore spaces, punctuation, and capitalization when looking for palindromes. 
For example, "A man, a plan, a canal. Panama!" is considered to be a palindrome.

To determine whether a string is a palindrome, the program converts the string to lower case;
then removes any non-letter characters from the string and compares the resulting string with the reverse of the same string.
If they are equal, then the original string is considered to be a palindrome.
